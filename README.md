## Introduction

This is the official repository for the paper [Synthetic SQL Column Descriptions and Their Impact on Text-to-SQL Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04691)

Relational databases often have ambiguous columns and hard-to-interpret values, hindering both human users and text-to-SQL models. This work leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate natural language descriptions for SQL database columns, enhancing text-to-SQL performance and automating metadata creation. We refined the column descriptions from the development set of the BIRD-Bench benchmark, developed a column difficulty taxonomy, and evaluated various LLMs. While models struggled with generating descriptions for inherently ambiguous columns, the generated descriptions consistently improved text-to-SQL performance, especially for larger models like GPT-4o and Qwen2 72B. Surprisingly, descriptions containing by annotators rated superflous information outperformed curated ones, indicating benefits from more comprehensive metadata. Future work will explore optimizing these descriptions and expanding metadata types.

## Dataset

As part of the study, we curate a dataset of column descriptions and their difficulty ratings based on the development set of [BIRD-Bench](https://bird-bench.github.io/). The dataset can be found in the `column_descriptions.csv` file in the top level directory. 

Columns were categorized into four difficulty levels: "Self-Evident," "Context-Aided," "Ambiguity-Prone," and "Domain-Dependent," based on the amount of information available in the database to generate accurate descriptions. We also included an alternative naming convention to make it more intuitive to interpret the difficulties of columns in the file: "Easy", "Medium", "Hard" and "Very Hard".

## LLM Outputs

To enable future research on what makes good column descriptions, we have uploaded all the generated column descriptions from the different evaluated LLMs to the `llm_outputs` folder. 

## Annotations

All annotations made for the paper can be found in the /annotations folder. 

## Code

Inference for the open-source models was performed on a cluster of several A100 GPUs, using BitsandBytes to load the models in 8-bit format. We set the model temperature to 0.7. 

Prompts and code for the different experiments can be found in the following files: 

1. Description generation: `src/description_generator.py`
2. Text-to-SQL evaluations: `src/text-to-sql.py`
3. LLM-as-a-judge: `src/judge.py`
